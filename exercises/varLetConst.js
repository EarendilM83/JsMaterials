//     1. declare variable 'language' and set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live
//     2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
//     change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
//     3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, console.log it out and observe what happens
